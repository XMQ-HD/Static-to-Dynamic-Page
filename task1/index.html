            <p class="first-paragraph">Did you know there's a national day for almost everything? Well, January 13<sup>th</sup> is officially Rubber Duck Day! To brighten your day, here's a quick dive into the history of our favorite bath-time companion.</p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">The concept of the rubber duck dates back to the late 1800s when Charles Goodyear, an American chemist, developed vulcanized rubber—a process that uses heat and sulfur to make rubber more durable, flexible, and waterproof. While Goodyear's invention wasn't specifically aimed at creating toys, it paved the way for rubber playthings as an unintended but delightful side effect.</p>
            <p class="third-paragraph">Early rubber ducks looked quite different from today's cheerful, floating versions. They were solid and heavy, making them poor swimmers (if they floated at all!). Originally designed as chew toys for babies and pets, these early ducks were more functional than fun—though probably not very gentle on tiny teeth!</p>
